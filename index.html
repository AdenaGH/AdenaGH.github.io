                    <h2>Let's Start Simple</h2>
                    <h3 class="content-text">Last time you went to the grocery store, did your eyes widen when you saw the prices in the produce section? Well ours did, and we wanted to learn more about how much prices of fruits and vegetables have actually increased in the past decade. There are many factors that affect the price of a produce good, but we'll dive deeper into that later. For now, let's just look at how much prices have increased from 2012-2022.</h3>

                    <h3 class="content-text">Now that we have seen the general price increases for produce based on packaging form, let's dive deeper and see which fruits and vegetables have had the highest increases in price since 2012.</h3>

                    <h2>How Much of the Produce is Actually Edible?</h2>
                    <h3 class="content-text">We've seen how much the prices of different produce items can fluctuate, but what some people fail to think about is the fact that just because we buy the whole fruit/vegetable that doesn't mean we can eat the whole thing. "Yield" is the word used to describe how much of the product is actually usable, let's take a look at what the yield is for some of our favorite produce products.  </h3>

                    <h2>Ok...What Now?</h2>
                    <h3 class="content-text">Think about everything you just learned next time you go to the grocery store. Instead of just grabbing the first bag of apples you see, ask yourself if you are getting the best value based on the information above. Will the recipe you are making taste the same if you buy canned apples instead of fresh? Could you switch it for pears since you know they have a higher yield? How many cups of sliced apples do you need for that pie, and can you acheive that amount with less apples than what is in the pre-packaged bag? These are just examples, but we implore you to take your newfound knowledge and apply it to your purchases. Learning about how your produce is priced can make you a more proactive consumer and can help you ensure you are getting the most bang for your buck at the grocery store.</h3>
